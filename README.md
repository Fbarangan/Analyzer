# Analyzer

The Analyzer in Microsoft Access is menu-driven, easy to use, generates valuable information -- useful for users, developers, designers, managers, and anyone who uses Access (and databases Access can connect to such as SQL Server)

The Analyzer documents databases, which can be SQL Server or other big data -- and Access too, of course. Use the Analyzer to create a list of table names, data dictionary, relationships, indexes, statistics about your data, and more.  In addition to being able to see all the code, you also see the the Analyzer results and use them however you wish; this this is invaluable tool for a developer.

The latest version of the Analyzer can loop through the directory of the database you choose and analyze multiple files. It is designed such that, if a list of databases to analyze were already in LF_Files, they would all be done. New Reports for Combined results.

The Analyzer can analyze big data, like databases that have links to SQL Server tables. Yes, the Analyzer easily documents what you have in SQL Server (or other big data) ! Simply link to tables from Access and analyze the database with links. Save the username and password in the connect string (you can delete a temporary Access database after the Analyzer is done).

When analyzing big data, the _Analyzer_ can take awhile to run, especially if you do the Value Analysis test. While running, you will see "Not Responding". This is normal and nothing to be concerned about.

The Analyzer gets a ton of information about your tables, fields, indexes, and relationships.  It also reads what is defined for forms and reports -- names, sources, controls, groups, sections, conditional formatting, and more.

It is recommended, as a general rule, to put the initial Analyzer download after unzipping into a reference folder you can find again.  When you want to analyze a project that is not related to other projects you have analyzed, make a copy of the blank Analyzer database to your project folder and then run the Analyzer.

The Analyzer is distributed as one file for ease of development.  Splitting tables into a back-end is your option.
What does the Analyzer do?

The Analyzer shows you what is in your database ... tables, fields, properties, relationships, indexes, ... data ... forms and reports, ....  Looking at data is just as important as looking at structure.  The Analyzer provides a way to document, understand, and optimize your database. Because it can also analyze the data that is stored, the more records you have in the database when you analyze it, the more the Analyzer can tell you.  Analyzing the same database on a regular basis is valuable to compare the number of records and value statistics in each table.

The 5 basic Analyzer reports are:

    Table Summary
    Deep Analysis (Data Dictionary + Value Analysis)
    Field List
    Table Indexes
    Relationships 

Additional reports include:

    Lookup Fields
    Database Information
    Linked Databases
    Table Detail
    Field Statistics
    Object Summary
    Form Record Sources
    Form Control RowSources
    Font Styles
    LOOK in Form Control or Row Source (prompts for a parameter).  

There are more than 50 reports, including reports to aggregate information about multiple databases.

What do you want to see? The Analyzer probably gets the data you need and if not, consider developing another Test for it.
How much does the Analyzer cost?

The Analyzer is free. All development is volunteer.
